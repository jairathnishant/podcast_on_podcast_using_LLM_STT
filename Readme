# YouTube Transcript → Summary → Podcast

This project provides a **Colab Notebook** that:
- Fetches transcripts from a YouTube video (using `youtube-transcript-api` if captions exist).
- Falls back to **Whisper (faster-whisper)** to generate transcripts if captions are unavailable.
- Summarizes the transcript using a Hugging Face summarization model (DistilBART).
- Converts the summarized text into podcast-style audio using Edge-TTS.
